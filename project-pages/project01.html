        <p>Cosmo is an app/website built using the Laravel framework, with PHP and Blade as its main technologies. 
            This project was created as the final exam (UAS) for the 2025 Back-End Programming course, and it was a 
            collaboration between me and four of my friends. Cosmo includes features similar to Instagram, such as posting, 
            commenting, liking, following, logging in and out, and more.
